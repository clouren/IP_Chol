This code is for exactly solving sparse SPD linear systems

It comprises both an Integer Preserving Up-Looking and Integer-Preserving Left-Looking 
Cholesky factorization.

This code is dependent on the following packages:

  -GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic (GMP) and GNU Multiple Precision Floating Point Reliable (MPFR) 
   libraries. Available at:

      https://gmplib.org/
      http://www.mpfr.org/

  -Approximate Minimum Degree (AMD) and Column Approximate Minimum Degree (COLAMD). Distributed
   along with this package, but may also be independently obtained at:
      http://www.suitesparse.com
      
  -Sparse Left-Looking Integer-Preserving (SLIP) LU. Distributed along with this package, but
   may also be independently obtained at
